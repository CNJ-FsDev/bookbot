# Bookbot
Welcome to my first project! I am going to build a "Book Bot" - a Python program that can analyse an entire book and print out an interesting statistical report.

Building a real command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein". Using VS Code, Git, and Github. This is the perfect first Python project for beginners.

Let's aggregate all the word and character data into a nice report that we can print to the console!
